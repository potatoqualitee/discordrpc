discordrpc works on PowerShell Core. This means that you can run all commands on <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong> and <strong>macOS</strong>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

After seeing the [Discord Presence](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=icrawl.discord-vscode) plugin for VS Code, I was inspired to do something similar with PowerShell.

I made `discordrpc` as flexible as possible, so you can make your presence all your own, even changing the icons that show up. A wrapper command has also been included to make getting started easy.

## Install

Ensure that Discord is running and that "Game Activity" enabled in your settings.

### Install from PowerShell Gallery

Run the following to install discordrpc from the PowerShell Gallery:

```powershell
Install-Module discordrpc -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Add to profile

`discordrpc` loads fast enough to add to your profile so everyone can always see when you're hanging out in PowerShell. Type `notepad $profile` then add these params and call the command.

```powershell
$params = @{
    Details        = "Version $($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major).$($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Minor)"
    State          = (Split-Path -Path $pwd -Leaf)
    Start          = "Now"
    UpdateScript   = {
        # show the directory you are in. you can do anything here.
        Update-DSRichPresence -State (Split-Path -Path $pwd -Leaf)
    }
}

Start-DSClient @params
```

That will show results similar to the image above. Want to add your own integration? Let's take a look at YouTube and Plex.


## Image Options
The following images are available to use within your configuration. If you'd like me to add any more, let me know.

## Highlights

* You don't just have to show up as Playing PowerShell, you can also select from a variety of templates within `Start-DSClient`
* If you don't find an application that matches your needs, you can [create your own application](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and use your own title and "assets" or icons/images
* You can use the wrapper command for ease or use the underlying commands individually for granular control

## Usage examples

### Integrate with other apps

#### Twitch
Here's a sample for Twitch using my other module [tvbot](https://github.com/potatoqualitee/twitch).

```powershell
$stream = Get-TvStream
$username = $stream.UserName
$params = @{
    Template       = "Twitch"
    Details        = $stream.Title
    State          = "$($stream.ViewerCount) Viewers"
    Start          = $stream.StartedAt
    Label          = "Watch Stream"
    Url            = "https://twitch.tv/$username"
    TimerRefresh   = 30
    UpdateScript   = {
        if (-not (Get-TvStream)) {
            Stop-DSClient
        }
    }
}

Start-DSClient @params
```

If I'm livestreaming, it'll appear like this..

#### Bigger combo command

In the command below, you can use a custom [application ID](https://discord.com/developers/applications/), customize your timer, see info messages and more.

```powershell
$params = @{
    ApplicationID  = "824593663883214948"
    LargeImageKey  = "avatar"
    LargeImageText = "Summoners Rift"
    SmallImageKey  = "icon"
    SmallImageText = "Lvl 7"
    Label          = "Potato ðŸ¥”"
    Url            = "https://github.com/potatoqualitee/discordrpc"
    Details        = "Version $($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major).$($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Minor)"
    State          = (Split-Path -Path $pwd -Leaf)
    LoggerType     = "ConsoleLogger"
    LoggerLevel    = "Info"
    TimerRefresh   = 10000
    Start          = "Now"
    UpdateScript   = {
        Update-DSAsset -LargeImageText "Timer worked!" -SmallImageText "Lvl 10"
        Update-DSRichPresence -State (Split-Path -Path $pwd -Leaf)
    }
}

Start-DSClient @params
```

This setup will show logs in the console, which is inconvenient unless you are debugging something.

#### Build your presence, step by step

Here's the code I used while testing the module. You can use this to see how different settings can change the presence.

```powershell
$assets = New-DSAsset -LargeImageKey avatar -LargeImageText "Summoners Rift" -SmallImageKey icon -SmallImageText "Lvl 7"
$timestamp = New-DSTimestamp -Start (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-3) -End (Get-Date).AddMinutes(3)
$button = New-DSButton -Label "Potato ðŸ¥”" -Url https://github.com/potatoqualitee/discordrpc
$party = New-DSParty -Size 10 -Privacy Public -Max 100
$presence = New-DSRichPresence -Asset $assets -State "presence.ps1" -Details "Some details" -Timestamp $timestamp -Buttons $button -Party $party
$logger = New-DSLogger -Type ConsoleLogger -Level Info
$client = New-DSClient -ApplicationID 824593663883214948 -Presence $presence -Logger $logger
```

# Known Issues

I can't get the potato link to click. I don't know what's up.

# Reference

Discord RPC is a library for interfacing your game with a locally running Discord desktop client. This PowerShell module wraps [Lachee's](https://github.com/Lachee) C# library, [discord-rpc-csharp](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp/)


You can visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) to learn more or create your own assets to set your own app name and icons. You'll need to change the `ApplicationID` to the client key you are provided.

When searching for a [list of Client IDs](https://github.com/potatoqualitee/discordrpc/blob/main/clientids.json) already available on Discord, I found the [PreMiD app](https://premid.app/), which is a mature product to show a bunch of rich presences (though not PowerShell). If you'd like to create your own Rich Presence for an app, the code in [their repo](https://github.com/PreMiD) may provide good strategies.
