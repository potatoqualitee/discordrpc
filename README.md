discordrpc works on PowerShell Core. This means that you can run all commands on <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong> and <strong>macOS</strong>.

After seeing the [Discord Presence](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=icrawl.discord-vscode) plugin for VS Code, I was inspired to do something similar with PowerShell.

I made `discordrpc` as flexible as possible, so you can make your presence all your own, even changing the icons that show up. Like most of the modules I write, I also included a wrapper command to make getting started easy.

This is what mine looked like while testing:

## Installer

Run the following to install discordrpc from the PowerShell Gallery:

```powershell
Install-Module discordrpc -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Add to profile

`discordrpc` loads fast enough to add to your profile so everyone can always see when you're hanging out in PowerShell. Type `notepad $profile` then add these params and call the command.

```powershell
$params = @{
    LargeImageKey  = "psavatar"
    LargeImageText = "Summoners Rift"
    SmallImageKey  = "icon"
    SmallImageText = "Lvl 7"
    Details        = "Version $($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major).$($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Minor)"
    State          = (Split-Path -Path $pwd -Leaf)
    Start          = "Now"
    UpdateScript   = {
        # show the directory you are in. you can do anything here.
        Update-DSRichPresence -State (Split-Path -Path $pwd -Leaf)
    }
}

Start-DSClient @params
```

## More advanced

```powershell
$params = @{
    LargeImageKey  = "psavatar"
    LargeImageText = "Summoners Rift"
    SmallImageKey  = "icon"
    SmallImageText = "Lvl 7"
    Label          = "Potato ðŸ¥”"
    Url            = "https://github.com/potatoqualitee/discordrpc"
    Details        = "Version $($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major).$($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Minor)"
    State          = (Split-Path -Path $pwd -Leaf)
    LoggerType     = "ConsoleLogger"
    LoggerLevel    = "Info"
    TimerRefresh   = 10000
    Start          = "Now"
    UpdateScript   = {
        Update-DSAsset -LargeImageText "Timer worked!" -SmallImageText "Lvl 10"
        Update-DSRichPresence -State (Split-Path -Path $pwd -Leaf)
    }
}

Start-DSClient @params
```
